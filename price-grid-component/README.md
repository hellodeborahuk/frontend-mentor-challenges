### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learnt how to take a design and build it in HTML and CSS. I styled for mobile first before doing the CSS for desktop.

### Continued development

I want to focus on learning more CSS, rather than relying on TailwindCSS.
